	The *mm helper helper scripts expect enums to be of the following form:

	typedef enum {
	    ...
	} Foo;

	This changeset makes the enums all follow this pattern so that the
	enum.pl script from glibmm can generate defs files properly.

	Note from Philip: please fix the enum.pl script from glibmm, if it
	doesn't support Tinymail's original notation, then it's simply wrong.

2009-09-25  Carl Simonson <simonsonc@gmail.com>

	tny-camel-folder.h includes camel-folder.h when it does not need to.
	Including it causes a problem when it is included in a C++ program.
	camel-folder. This fixes the problem for C++ programs that include
	tny-camel-folder.h. However, renaming variables in camel-folder.h may
	be a good thing to implement, which should be done in the upstream
	camel library.

2009-09-25  Carl Simonson <simonsonc@gmail.com>

	Some public header files are missing G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS macros which
	are helpful for C++ as they are 'extern "C"' wrappers.

	(tny_fs_stream_cache_get_stream, tny_fs_stream_cache_remove)
	(fill_from_cache): protect the access to priv->cached_files to
	make the TnyFsStream thread-safe

	* libedataserver/e-iconv.c (e_iconv_charset_name): added a
	security check to prevent SIGSEVs caused by specially malformed
	huge charset names.

2009-08-10  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (cmd_tocache):
	protect a buffer passed to strlen with the null character '\0' in
	order to fix a conditional jump reported by valgrind

2009-08-07  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c
	(recurse_folders_async_cb): remove the folders already present on
	model that are not listed by provider

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(tny_camel_folder_get_folders_default): do not reuse iter when
	getting the folders and refresh=TRUE

2009-08-05  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c (folder_changed): replaced
	_tny_camel_header_set_as_memory calls by _tny_camel_header_set_camel_message_info

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-header.c
	(_tny_camel_header_set_camel_message_info): add a hook to finalize
	of summary object. This will prevent double frees of the folder summary.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c (notify_folder_store_observers_about_in_idle)
	(notify_folder_observers_about_in_idle): check that session is not
	NULL before adding a reference to it as it could cause an invalid dereference

	* libtinymail/tny-fs-stream-cache.c (fill_from_cache): fixed a
	memory leak.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(transfer_msgs_thread_clean): clear exception to prevent memory leaks.

2009-08-03  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(transfer_msgs_thread_clean): removed invalid code

	* camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c
	(process_idle_untagged_response): fixed a small memory leak

2009-07-30  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c
	(idle_thread): loop while the store->idle_thread is not assigned, to
	avoid unexpected behavior for not being able to detect if we're
	starting or stopping idle from idle thread.

2009-07-27  Javier Jardon  <javierjc11982@gmail.com>

	* tests/c-demo/tny-demoui-summary-view.c (recursive_all_folders):
	* libtinymailui-mozembed/tny-moz-embed-msg-view.c
	(tny_moz_embed_msg_view_create_mime_part_view_for_default):
	removed some Gtk+ deprecated symbols

2009-07-27  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	Avoid a crash iterating in imap summary if it's corrupted.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c
	(imap_update_summary): if summary is bigger than the sequence number
	coming from server, summary is corrupt. We were iterating wrongly to
	remove the extra elements, and could cause a crash.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c (folder_tracking_changed):
	reimplemented to load the summary when we get a folder changed
	event from camel, and use the standard folder_changed handler.
	Avoids crashes if the camel folder is freed earlier than
	folder changed handling finishes.

2009-07-27  Lucas Maneos <tinymail@subs.maneos.org>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	avoid sending an empty ENABLE command when the IMAP server's
	CAPABILITY response does not list any supported extensions.

2009-07-20  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c (get_parent_full_name):
	there was a reference leak in this method, as the recursion for
	getting the list of all parents was not properly freeing the
	objects.

2009-07-16  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c (folder_tracking_changed):
	always update the folder counts not only if we receive changed
	uids but when we get added uids and removed uids
	(folder_tracking_finalize)
	(_tny_camel_folder_track_folder_changed)
	(tny_camel_folder_finalize): user_data is now priv instead of self
	(folder_tracking_changed): do not do anything if the folder is
	already loaded as the folder_changed signal will handle the changes

2009-07-14  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(tny_camel_folder_get_msg_async_thread): do not check for
	CAMEL_IS_OBJECT as a CamelOperation is not a CamelObject

2009-07-13  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-header-list-model.c 
	(tny_gtk_header_list_model_prepend): don't restart
	the views notify timeout on each message add.

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-header-list-model.c: initial
	views notify timeout run in 1 ms.

2009-07-10  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	on disconnecting from network, avoid any network communication if we're
	in idle loop and we don't have the idle lock. This avoids some crashes
	on starting idle if connection is shutdown.

2009-07-03  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-header-list-model.c
	(notify_views_add): speed up the first views update.

2009-06-30  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c: remove
	mark_for_removal handling as this is breaking delayed refresh
	mode, and also detecting new folders in some cases.

2009-06-29  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c:
	reenable poke_status calls in delayed refresh mode.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.[ch], 
	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder-priv.h
	(tny_camel_folder_track_folder_changed): added a method to add 
	a CamelFolder instance to track folder_changed event until it's
	finalized. This is useful to track only the number of messages 
	available.
  
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: added handling of 
	folder_opened signal. When a folder is opened, we register it for
	tracking the number of messages. THis allows us to track the
	number of messages without opening the folder summary.

2009-06-22  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(tny_camel_folder_get_headers_default): get headers now
	returns the headers in the reverse order (first we return
	latest messages). This makes tinymail behave better in the
	usual context (reading the newest messages).

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c: stop delayed
	refresh once timeout is gone (avoiding continuous retrieval
	issue with delayed refresh).

2009-06-22  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c
	(tny_camel_mime_part_get_parts_default): added a couple of extra
	checks that prevent crashes with malformed messages

2009-06-19  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c: delay refresh
	not only on adding accounts, but on each step of get folders
	operation. Also removing the delayed refresh on connection event
	is now disabled, as we usually get hte connection event too 
	soon.

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c: cancel account
	operations on removing them from store (to allow stopping get
	folders operation).

2009-06-16  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* New libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-html-to-text-stream.[ch]:
	new stream that wraps a stream with html format, so its output
	is a plain text version of that stream.

2009-06-15  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c (check_cancel): call
	tny_camel_send_queue_cancel_default instead of the interface
	function in order to prevent call loops when applications want to
	subclass TnyCamelSendQueue

2009-06-12  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c. New method
	_tny_camel_store_account_refresh_children. This is used for
	checking to recurse folders for knowing if there are new
	folders available.

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.[ch]: implemented new
	"delayed refresh" flag. This is for telling store to act as
	offline in first seconds, but then do an online refresh. With this
	we get immediate view of cached folders, but after a while we get
	a network access so we see new folders.

2009-06-11  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c (handle_connect)
	(on_connection_event, tny_maemo_conic_device_connect_async)
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init)
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Now the maemo conic device
	supports multiple requests for connections

2009-06-10  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c (on_account_connect_done):
	Fixed a regression added in r3926

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(_tny_camel_folder_freeup_observers): protect the access to the
	observers list when freeing it

2009-06-08  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-gnomevfs/tny-vfs-stream.c (tny_vfs_stream_write):
	return -1 in case of error which is the value that CamelStream
	understands as error.

2009-06-04  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c (on_account_connect_done):
	Notify observers when a connection fails due to disk full conditions

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c
	(tny_camel_store_account_get_folders_default): unref the right
	instance of CamelStore

	of the mime parts in get_parts.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c
	(get_folders_sync_ns_only_lsub): handle the case of
	parse_list_response_as_folder_info returning NULL

2009-05-21  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(tny_camel_folder_poke_status_default): don't set the poke_status
	operation as auto-cancellable

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c (check_cancel): don't
	cancel always after sending the first email of the send queue. It
	was the consequence of a typo

2009-05-19  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: reason/unreason the
	destination folder on copy_async, to avoid freeing the summary
	and then crashing on subsequent access.

2009-05-18  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c
	(tny_camel_send_queue_cancel_default): Use an asynchronous call
	when canceling sendings in order not to cause deadlocks

2009-05-15  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c
	(tny_camel_send_queue_cancel_default): use sync_sync to refresh
	the outbox instead of the deprecated and dangerous tny_folder_sync
	because the later could cause summary corruptions when combined
	with asynchronous calls

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c
	(tny_gtk_folder_list_store_on_constatus_changed):
	do not perform always a get_folders with refresh=TRUE. Take into
	account the NO_REFRESH flag

2009-05-12  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c (create_worker):
	removed an unused variable error. No need to emit the error as it
	will be handled by the caller of create_worker

2009-05-08  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	** Original patch by Dmitry Kazachkov with some slight modifications

	* libtinymail-camel/camel/camel-store-summary.c (store_info_load,

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c (thread_main): sync
	outbox and sent folder in a sync-like way to avoid loosing syncs

	* Avoid assert if content location is an empty string.

2009-04-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.c:
	added flag "no refresh" to allow creating folder list stores
	that don't do any "forced" refresh (unless it's caused by
	reconnects).

2009-04-14  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-progress-info.c (tny_progress_info_idle_func):
	fixes a potential NULL dereference

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-mime-utils.c

	for reading split addresses.

2009-03-29  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-mime-part-utils.c:
	take into account the original substream bounds to calculate the new
	substream bounds on creating new message structure (fixes parsing
	of PGP signed messages)

2009-03-24  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-list-store.[ch]: added
	activity feedback, to allow developers to know when the
	list store is fetching data (to show some kind of progress
	feedback).

2009-03-24  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c

	* Fix for previous "refresh" commit.

2009-03-11  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: now
	get_folders "refresh" parameter forces to fetch again
	the list of folders. This way we can acknowledge when
	there are new folders available on server.

2009-03-06  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c
	(tny_session_queue_going_online_for_account):

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c
	(_tny_camel_folder_guess_folder_type): Improved detection of
	folders called 'inbox'. If the parent is not an account then it's
	unlikely to be a 'real' inbox

2009-02-27  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/tny-camel-folder.c: disable push email
	on uncaching (to avoid keeping current folder active in store when
	we're not reading it anymore).

2009-02-16  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	fix bad access to namespaces due to bad reusage of pointer.

	added "protected" functions to properly add/remove folders to/from
	managed_folders list.

2009-01-29  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c

	for the folder store.

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.[ch]:
	Added support for settings construction flags. Also added a flag
	"show path" for the tree model, that makes it store the full path 
	name.

2008-11-21  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@iglaia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-default-connection-policy.c: added

	Add some documentation about the behaviour of tny_folder_refresh_async()

2008-11-21  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>
 
	* revert last changeset:
	We want this to be fixed a better way	 

2008-11-20  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* camel operation:
	adding camel_operation_mute/unmute() and use it to filter the progress
	events. This prevents to send bad progress when refreshing an IMAP folder

2008-11-20  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>
 
 	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap:
 	For IMAP, we open 2 sessions: one for standard operations, the other
 	for fetching messages. This makes concurrent accesses to the folder summary
 	therefore corrupting it.
 	This happens e.g when you delete a message and fetch a new one afterwards.
 	This patch adds the "dont_touch_summary" parameter to prevent the GetMsg session to
 	mess up too much.

2008-11-20  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: guess folder type from name if
	we couldn't know the folder type from camel.

2008-11-19  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c:
	Fix a camel_operation leak introduced in r3767. This had the side effect
	of triggering a "**: Camel operation status stack non empty:" warning 
	 when trying to sync a POP account

2008-11-19  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue-priv.h
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c: added some locking to
	prevent two send queue threads running at the same time.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c
	(tny_camel_mime_part_decode_to_stream_default):
	adds a reference to protect wrapper when decoding to a stream

2008-11-19  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c:
	Remove calls to camel_imap_folder_start_idle that could happen even
	when idle was locked by an operation, causing hangs.

2008-11-18  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* Avoid criticals on calling can_idle if queue does not have service.

2008-11-17  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: 2 small bugfixes in 
	tny_camel_store_account_store_refresh().
	- fix a reference leak
	- fix we were reporting the subfolders to the observer instead of 
	  just the folders

2008-11-18  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: several bugfixes. Fixed an
	invalid comparison (a typo most likely). Fixed several memory
	leaks as well in some lists that were not freed.
	(load_folder_no_lock): removed a duplicated instruction.
	Added several initializations of cancelled field all around the
	code.
	(tny_camel_folder_copy_shared): removed needless code and fixed a
	memory leak.
	(tny_camel_folder_get_folders_default): fixed an useless asignment

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part-priv.h: Moved a function
	header into the #ifdef

2008-11-13  Thomas Guillem  <thomas.guillem@gmail.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-message-cache.c:
	Change the default cache filename from "uid." to "uid.~" in order to
	keep compatibility with FAT32 partitions. (a FAT32 file can't end with '.')
	Old cache files ("uid.") are still compatible.

2008-11-10  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	Complete rework of the lock behavior of Tinymail
	(camel) imap IDLE implementation.

        The problem we want to fix is: sometimes IDLE thread causes
	deathlocks (connect lock, idle lock, g_thread_join, etc).
	This happens easily when there are disconnects, or
	when we switch fast among folders.

        The main changes are:
        * Provided a count of reasons to stop idle because of connect lock.
        * If a caller has taken connect lock, then it should do the send done
	stuff itself.
        * Idle thread has the connect lock always when it's in the body of the
	loop.
        * In any point, if we want to  take the connect lock, then we should
	stop idle. No partial idle can be alive when we want to connect.
        * Camel queue enables/disables the possibility to start idle. That's
	for avoiding running IDLE / SEND DONE in the middle of queued
	operations.

2008-11-10  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: Uninitialized value, fixed

2008-11-10  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* Specify with defines the IDLE tick time (time between iterations in
	idle loop) and IDLE default delay (time between IDLE/DONE cycles if no
	event happens).

	* Fix the IDLE delay account parameter to take into account the tick
	time.

2008-10-30  Thomas Guillem  <thomas.guillem@gmail.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c: Fixed a typo

2008-10-30  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

	* Make folder pokes cancelable

2008-10-30  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	Makes tny_camel_account_set_online (FALSE) send "QUIT" 
	for POP3 accounts. It also cleans up the logged_in 
	variable that was unused. This fixes some problems I 
	had with Yahoo servers when trying to connect twice in 
	a row.

2008-10-29  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtininymail-camel/tny-camel-bs-msg.[ch]:
	Added implementation of methods get/set allow external images to avoid
	crashes on code using this if using the bodystructure retrieve
	strategy.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-tcp-stream-ssl.c:
	Now we use PR_INTERVAL_NO_WAIT (value is 0) instead of putting
	0 as interval parameter for PR_Connect. Should help code
	readability.

2008-10-27  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

	* Re-submission for the add-tny_merge_folder_store() patch.
	It allows to merge folder stores.

2008-10-26  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>
	    & Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* Re-submission for the add-tny_camel_send_queue_new_with_folders() patch:
	It allows to create a Camel SendQueue with user-supplied outbox and sendbox

2008-10-24  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>
	    & Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* Re-submission for the add-a-refresh-parameter-to-tny_folder_store_get_folder():
	makes the patch atomic by adapting to the new api where needed
	also honour the camel folders flags (caused some critical camel warnings else)

	* This was a major API change

2008-10-16  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Reverted `svn diff -r 3774:3775`, the behaviour of the folders was
	incorrect. This was a commit that combined multiple of Rob's patches
	together. The entire commit was probably not entirely wrong, but the
	behaviour must be fixed before re-approval can take place.

2008-10-16  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-file-utils.c: (camel_write)
	only write in chunks when writing to sockets, do not do it when
	writing to a local filesystem. This speeds up writings a lot.
	*
	libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/local/camel-maildir-summary.c:
	adds an extra check that prevents crashes when reading data from
	corrupted media.

2008-09-23  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

	Give tny_folder_store_get_folders a refresh parameter, for optionally not refreshing from the server.
	Add tny_folder_store_refresh_async that will asynchronously refresh the store from the server, emitting TnyFolderStoreChanged events to observers.
	Implement it all for camel.

	* libtinymail/tny-folder-store-change.h:
	New observer behaviour. Observers will get folders_appeared events when a
	tny_folder_store_refresh or tny_folder_store_get_folders occurs and the cache
	is loaded for the first time. They get folders_created events when a new folder
	appears that we didn't know about before.

2008-09-23  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c
	(let_idle_die): do a trylock in connect_lock instead of lock, so that

2008-08-31  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

2008-08-31  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

	* libtinymail/tny-progress-info.c: Make the sofar/oftotal field in
	TnyProgress more sensible when one of the is negative.  In general one
	of these ill be negative right at the start of an operation, and if
	one is 0, then the other is generally gibberish, so 0/0 is more
	sensible.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:

2008-08-27  Martin Bonnin  <martinbonnin@gmail.com>

	* This removes the "Warning: invalid file descriptor -1 in syscall 
	close()" seen when using valgrind with tinymail. stream_close() is 
	called twice in a row on the same stream.  There might be more 
	implications than just this valgrind warning, full details here

2008-07-16  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.[ch]:
        Added fetching aol specific imap capability.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.[ch]:
        Now we use FETCH instead of SEARCH for getting the UID's
        when the server is AOL.
        Added an extra check in imap_get_uids. If server gives a list
        including sequence numbers we didn't request, we ignore them.
        This should fix the AOL problem fetching headers.

2008-07-16  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	nor required. This method is responsible for freeing the common
	threads management code, including the lock that's accessed on the
	crash in __nptl_deallocate_tsd.

2008-07-01  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-provider.[ch]:
        Now providers offer a new shutdown handler, that will be
        called on shutting down camel.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel.c:
        Use the providers shutdown handler on shutting down camel.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-provider.c:
        Implement new provider shutdown handler, to kill the login delay
        threads on shutting down tinymail.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-store.[ch]:
        New method to kill the login delay thread. This is used to kill
        the thread on shutting down tinymail.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-provider.c:
        Set as NULL the default shutdown handler.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-pop-store-account.c:
        Manage properly the internal inbox reference to avoid leaking it.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-mime-utils.c:
        Parse properly broken rfc2047 recipient headers sent from gmail imap.

2008-06-26  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed LIST (SUBSCRIBED) for some IMAP servers

2008-06-25  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c
	(..._get_header_pairs_default): we were leaking all the TnyPair objects
	created here. Fixed.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
        Don't set in_idle to false so that join works properly.
        On disconnecting we forze a stop_idle so we warrant idle
        thread has died when we disconnect. Also, send let idle die commands
	on disconnecting. It's very important to make the idle thread die
	on time as it keeps a reference to the folder. Folder keeps a reference to
        this store, and then store should finish idle soon to be able
        to finalize (cycle reference).

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c:
        On finishing the idle thread we state we're out of it.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel.c:
        Avoid running internal methods of camel_shutdown two times if
        we can call shutdown two times.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c:
        Keep a proper reference to TnyDevice.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c:
        Free the iter store reference on finalising.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
        Set service to null after unreffing it.

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c:
        * Don't get folders again when we change status to disconnected.

	thread if this has not been created yet.

	* Changelog: removed many end-of-line whitespaces.

2008-06-18  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-shared.h:
        Added stream cache classes and handlers

	* libtinymail/tny-stream-cache.[ch]:
        Interface for streams caches. It's mostly intended for image
        remote streams.

	* libtinymail/tny-fs-stream-cache.[ch]:
        Implementation of TnyStreamCache interface using a local
        folder for storage. This implementation tries to keep the
        size of the cached streams lower than 1 MB.

	* libtinymail/tny-cached-file.[ch]:
        Data object to store status information of currently cached
        files. It also controls the process of fetching the remote
        streams, and creation of streams reading from cache.

	* libtinymail/tny-cached-file-stream.[ch]:
        Streams wrapping TnyFsStream, that access the cache files
        waiting when they're not completely fetched yet.

	* libtinymail/Makefile.am:
        Added stream cache implementation files.

2008-06-10  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	Added the proper error domain do some errors

2008-06-09  Rob Taylor  <rob.taylor@codethink.co.uk>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	Some mail servers use a namespace for their inbox, but inbox
	is also a top-level folder. This special-cases it so we get the
	flags of INBOX and also do the rest of our INBOX special casing.

2008-06-05  Mark Doffman  <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	* bindings/python/*
	Update .override and .defs files to reflect changes
	in tinymail interfaces.

        user acceptation to allow mail client to fetch external images
        referenced in a message.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg.[ch]:
        Implement new public methods get/set allow external images
        available in TnyMsg interface. It uses TnyCamelFolder for
        implementation of storage of the flag.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c,
	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder-priv.h:
        In camel we delegate on folder for storing the "get external
        images" flag. Then we expose a private method for this, that
        will be called in TnyMsg public implementation.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-folder.[ch]:
        Add new virtual methods (not implemented here) for getting
        and setting "get external images" flag for each message.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-data-cache.[ch]:
        Implementation of storage of "get external images" flag in
        data cache. It stores a file with extension getimages in the
        same folder the message contents are retrieved.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/nntp/camel-nntp-folder.c:
        Implement get/set allow external images methods. It stores
        it in the camel data cache using the methods the cache
        exposes for this.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c:
        Implement get/set allow external images methods. It also uses
        the data cache as nntp provider.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c:
        Implement get/set allow external images methods. It relies on
        proper implementation in imap messages cache.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-message-cache.[ch]:
        Add storage of allow external images flag. It saves an empty
        file with extension getimages per allowed file (similar to
        is partial flag approach).

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/local/camel-maildir-folder.c:
        Implement get/set allow external images methods. It stores
        an empty file for each message in the folder maildir metadata
        directory (the one on top of cur, new and tmp).

2008-05-12  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c: Add camel folder reason to
	sentbox and outbox while sending, as we can get unreasons and have
	then crash because the message cache is freed. (Based on a previous
	patch by Dape)

2008-05-09  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
          Add some reasons/unreasons in get_headers_operation, to avoid
          getting a 0 account when we are replacing the headers in the

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.[ch]:
        Now references to current_folder, old_folder and last_folder
        are weak references. This way, when they're finalized we
        properly remove the store reference to them.
        Removed some small leaks and compilation warnings.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store-priv.h:
        Added. Includes internal declarations of weak reference handlers
        for folders in the imap store.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c,
	libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c:

	* These problems got highlighted during pre-release 0.0.9
	* Build environment improvements
	* Added --enable-debug=yes (default is no),

	tny_header_dup_ api. This should be a bit better for
	being thread safe. Also modified code using this. The
	goal is being able to do the string copy in a lock.

	* Now moving a folder copies all the cached messages,
	but not the summaries, to avoid crashes trying to
	reuse the old summary.

	This is a major API change.

	* This was a minor API change

2008-03-20  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Implementation of a connect() that will timeout within 15 seconds
	for the non-SSL connection types. Experimental.

2008-03-19  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fast message moves when source and dest folder are both Maildir

2008-03-19  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Bugfix when sending large E-mails to GMail's SMTP service
	* When a large mail is being sent, it takes a long time to move it
	from Outbox to Sentbox. If during that time a flush() is requested on
	the TnySendQueue, then it's possible that the message gets send twice.
	To avoid this, we mark the message as TNY_HEADER_FLAG_ANSWERED

2008-03-18  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* Small bugfix in libtinymail-maemo

2008-03-18  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	we don't have priority flag, for avoiding using heuristics.

2008-03-16  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added extra insurance that an INBOX folder will be present

	* libtinymail-gnome-desktop/tny-gnome-device.c:
	(tny_gnome_device_is_online) if we try to get the network
	state and find that the network manager context is invalid,
	we shutdown it AND after this we nullify the context
	reference.

2008-03-12  Alberto Garcia Gonzalez <agarcia@igalia.com>

	* Reverted the "Leave on disk, MIME parsing" patch, as it's
	causing serious problems.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	Now poke_status only tries to do the job if folder is
	connected/active. Should prevent getting lots of attempts to
	connect in queue that have to be finished later.

2008-03-07  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* tests/c-demo/tny-demoui-summary-view.c:
	Added a simple syntax to provide different parent folders
	in rename/copy operation. Now you can provide
	paths as "/newfolder", "../another-parent/folder", etc.

2008-03-06  Alberto Garcia Gonzalez <agarcia@igalia.com>

	* tinymail/libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mem-stream.h
	* tinymail/libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mem-stream.c:

	* Check-for-duplicates in TnyFolderObserver and TnyFolderMonitor
	* Introduction of tny_gtk_header_list_model_set_no_duplicates
	* Introduction of tny_gtk_header_list_model_get_no_duplicates for
	completeness of language bindings who'll make getters/setters from
	this.

	* This was a minor API change

2008-03-04  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Leave on disk, MIME parsing. Highly experimental

2008-03-04  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	Now, when we get the parts of a mime part that's a message,
	we check if any part has an attachment content disposition,
	and update the attachments flag properly.
	* Moved bodystructure parser to camel, so that we
	can use it there.
	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/bs/bodystruct.c:

	including BODYSTRUCTURE prefix.

2008-03-04  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

        * Attempt at making mime parsing use the seekable capability of

	always, even when we're setting the same pass func again.

2008-02-27  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	Now we regenerate the addrinfo on each call to connect_to_server_wrapper.

2008-02-21  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	Do not lose the filename of the attachment disposition in
	case we set it as purged.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue-priv.h,
 	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c:
 	Now we don't send the run-queue-stop signal until
 	we've processed all sent signals.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c:
	Added a missing else that could cause freeing some summary info entries
	when they shouldn't

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c:

	devices

2008-01-29  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed reference counting for all TnyIterator implementations

2008-01-28  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Removed the _func from all the interfaces and virtual function
	pointers in the classes. This should not be an ABI but is an API
	change.

	* This was a major API change

2008-01-28  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added skeleton for unfinished DotNet bindings. This wont work yet,
	it seems gapi2 is generating a few *Implementor types incorrectly.

2008-01-27  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Various code improvements
	* Merged camel-lite with upstream camel revision 8428

2008-01-26  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Experimental expunge handling. Less expunging from the local
	summary will be needed, as we'll more carefully calculate which of the
	sequence vs. uids got removed. Please keep an eye on this one and
	revert in needed. This commit should reduce the "Expunged" labels that
	you might have been seeing in tny E-mail clients too.

2008-01-26  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Workaround for a known problem that ain't easy to solve right now:
	expunged headers stay around for too long. When this is detected, a
	dummy header is returned (with as flags TNY_HEADER_FLAG_EXPUNGED)
	* Finished Sergio's API change

	* This was a major API change

2008-01-25  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Some IMAP servers don't instantly update sessions that where not in
	IDLE when in monitoring service IDLE received an EXISTS. Tinymail
	received that EXISTS, does a SEARCH to get the new UIDs, fetches the
	envelope information and displays it to the user. If the user had
	already received message recently, it will keep that message-receive
	socket running (cached) for some time (optimalization). The IMAP
	servers don't always bring that other session up-to-date about the new
	information acquired in the first session in IDLE. For example GMail's
	IMAP server and Exchange seem to not update the not-in-IDLE session.

	This commit changed the behaviour in two ways: the get-message service
	is early-killed in case an EXISTS line arrives in the in-IDLE session,
	each message-fetch request in the get-message service is prepended
	with a NOOP (some IMAP servers will sync the session upon NOOP).

	Obviously, this is experimental behaviour. Please test this a lot!

2008-01-23  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-send-queue.c
	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c
	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.h
	(tny_send_queue_add_async): added this method that was available in
	the Camel implementation to the interface
	(create_worker)
	(thread_main): added the "queue-start" and "queue-stop" signals that
	are emitted before and after the queue processes the messages

	* This was a major API change

2008-01-22  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added support for GtkHTML in libtinymailui-gtkhtml. This is highly
	experimental and unfinished at this moment
	* Fixed several compiler warnings, and cleaned up some code

	* This was a minor API change

2008-01-21 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* fix freeing uninitialized data in camel-imap-folder.c

2008-01-21  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-send-queue.c
	libtinymail/tny-send-queue.h
	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c
	libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-send-queue.c:
	(tny_send_queue_cancel): API change, now the cancel method receives a
	flag specifying the action that should be performed on cancelations,
	to remove the messages or just to suspend them
	(thread_main): make the tny_transport_account_send cancellable

2008-01-20  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Refactoring of all error reporting situations, errors and handling
	of connection failures, reconnecting and getting messages in case of a
	previous connection failure.
	* Several bugfixes related to connection failures
	* Several bugfixes related to connection problems when fetching
	messages
	* POP and IMAP now behave the same in case of connection problems
	while fetching a message (they try to re-authenticate and re-connect)
	* More finegrained error reporting (IO errors, SERVICE errors, SYSTEM
	errors and unknown errors).

	* This was a major API change for all modules

2008-01-19  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed sync when offline transfers took place

2008-01-17  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder:
	(folder_changed): removed a code that was modifying the number of
	cached messages when receiving an IDLE notification of expunged
	headers. It shouldn't be done because Camel was already giving us the
	proper value

2008-01-16  Mark Doffman  <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>
	* bindings/python/*.defs: Regenerate .defs files for updated API.

	* bindings/python/*.override: Add missing headers and Gtk types.

	* initialize some priv-> member in TnyMaemoConicDevice

2008-01-14  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Some aggresive memory checking revealed a few interesting memory
	leaks. This commit fixes those. The fixes are experimental, although
	most of them double checked.

	CamelOperation holds one more significant memory leak at its
	status_hack linked list. That one is not yet fixed.
	* Flag setting to 0xffff must be 0x1fff as bit 13 and 14 are system
	bits that should not be altered like that.

2008-01-13  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Changed tny_mime_part_construct_from_stream to
	tny_mime_part_construct, added a parameter for the

	camel-mime-utils.c and camel-charset-map.c
	More information here:
	http://mail.gnome.org/archives/evolution-hackers/2007-December/msg00079.html

2007-12-24  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Merging with Camel upstream
	* When offline, folders in namespace that had a parent that was not
	subscribed, were not accessible. This was because the parents where
	not created, as LSUB didn't list those. This patch creates the
	parents.

2007-12-23  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Removed libtinymail-queues and libtinymail-asyncworker since those
	two libs are not going to be supported in Tinymail 1.0

        * libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.[hc] : adapted the functions that
                implemented the previous two functions to comply with their new
                signatures.
        * libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-bs-mime-part.[hc] : adapted the functions
                that implemented the previous two functions to comply with their
                new signatures.
        * libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/local/camel-maildir-store.c:

	list locally.
	* Detailed progress info for BODY fetches

2007-12-13  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added the TnyConnectionPolicy type for coping with connectivity
	changes (for example sheduling a reconnect or asking the user what to
	do about the event of a lost connection)

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header.c: now the decorated header
	can be added with g_object_ref or a weak reference.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: now the TnyCamelHeader we
	use to retrieve the message in find_msg is constructed from summary.
	This is created in a way it's persistent, and then, we can access
	properly to the summary flags. We also eturn null and set error if
	message is not in summary.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-full-msg-receive-strategy.c

	construction make sure that you don't download the part's content
	until you expand the expander).

	* add a dummy conic device, so libtinymail-maemo does
	  not require libconic anymore

	anymore. On top of that have I seen backtraces where a g_idle is not
	used where it should be.

2007-11-21  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c:

	* Bugfix makes ENABLE not happen if login failed
	* Completed the implementation of TnyMergeFolder, shortened its locks

	* Merged by Philip Van Hoof, bug found by Milan Crha

	* camel-spool-store.c (free_folder_info):
	Missed that CamelSpoolStore has its own free_folder_info()
	implementation (why?).  Change it to use g_slice_free().

2007-11-16  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* The cache deleter. A little bit of rework
	* Hardening Tinymail a little bit

2007-11-16  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/local/camel-maildir-folder.c:
	Now rewrite folder gets the filename of the messages to rewrite from the
	message info instead of using simply the message uid.

2007-11-16  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Bugfix in TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel: the signals where not being
	disconnected when the instance finalised.
	* Disconnecting signals
	* Cache deleter must also unreference the service instance
	* Cache deleter must make sure that summary of folder instances is
	not written anymore

2007-11-15  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect):
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect_async): added a new parametter called
	user_requested that specifies whether or not the connection was
	requested by an user or by an automatic system (like a daemon). This
	allows the connection not to succed when the device is sleeping.

2007-11-15  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Updating attachment flags after downloading of message
	* Bugfix, bug detected by Milan Crha (alloc must be a alloc0)

	* A few new argument guards here and there (e.g. g_return_if_fail).
	* Tons of little whitespace and coding style fixes.

2007-11-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Changed a hard reference into a weak reference, although I'm not
	sure that this was necessary.
	* Fixed two bugs: first that for transport-account the
	tny_camel_account_set_online's callback was never called for, second
	that the TnyCamelSendQueue was making TnyCamelFolder crash since
	yesterday's reference count fixes

2007-11-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Weak references for TnyHeader instances in TnyCamelMsgHeader
	* Reference counting mistakes in TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel
	* Reference counting mistakes in TnyGtkAccountListModel

2007-11-12  Vivek Sekar  <viveksekar@gmail.com>

	* Renamed the control files with respect to the new maemo versions.

2007-11-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Tryout lockup fix

2007-11-09  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	Added a new API to allow asynchronous connections
	in the Maemo conic device. This patch is a new version of an initial
	patch developed by pvanhoof with some changes.
	Splitted the Maemo connic device in two files, one for the actual
	device and the other one for a dummy device (useful for sbox devel)
	Fixed a problem when linking the maemo conic device

2007-11-08  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-common.c:
	(split_recipients): now we strip the obtained addresses to
	avoid adding unmeaningful spaces to addresses.

2007-11-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Backported changes from Pre release 0.0.4 preparations
	* Simulated weak references in TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel for the
	observers
	* Cyclic references fix. tny_folder_store_add_observer and
	tny_folder_add_observer no longer add strong references, instead they
	add weak references

	* Fixed longstanding bug that when you create two folders A and B in a
	root folder C, and then move A into B, that A would only become a
	subfolder of B after you restart the application. The problem was that
	A and B got created with _tny_camel_folder_new instead of the
	tny_camel_store_account_factor_folder. This made the observers
	infrastructure of the model confuse when a new list of folder was
	requested (this new list would use the tny_camel_store_account_factor_folder
	function and therefore another (new) instance would get created in
	stead of the one created during _tny_camel_folder_new being reused.

	For future, let's be extremely careful not to use
	_tny_camel_folder_new but instead to make sure that the factory is
	always used.

	* This is a major API change

2007-11-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Some problems fixed in TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel when moving
	folders around into newly created folders
	* Minor corrections when creating and moving folders
	* Bugfix when copying a folder into its own store under another name

2007-11-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Rare but possible race condition when creating the IDLE thread,
	marked the sections as critical by locking them.
	* Check for folder==NULL in imap-command
	* Rare but possible race condition when refreshing POP folders
	* Introduction of tny_list_remove_matches. This is automatically
	implemented if absent.
	* Usage of tny_list_remove_matches to avoid duplicates in the
	TnyFolderMonitor
	* USage of tny_list_remove_matches to implement expunge removals in
	the TnyFolderMonitor

	* This was a minor API change

2007-11-05  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Don't leak an fp in md5_get_digest_from_file

2007-11-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Merged with upstream Camel revision 8186
	* Merged bugfix http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430420
	* Fixed a warning during the build procedure, detecting Mozilla
	version

2007-11-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Bugfix when renaming or moving a local folder. Not all of its sub-
	folders where recreated (if the flags where 0, CamelStore's
	camel_store_get_folder_info returned an iter with only one child in it.
	Either it should return no childs or all childs. I adapted Tinymail to
	request all childs. This is tny-camel-folder.c:3084 (under the was_new
	if). Please keep an eye on this one!

2007-11-01  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* GHost items when renaming a local folder, fixed
	* Date-Received date = Date header for messages that never got
	received (like newly created messages in a Draft folder)
	* Introduction of tny_gtk_folder_store_tree_model_stop_observing
	* Introduced locking for OpenSSL
	* Added a virtual create_header_view_func to TnyGtkMsgView

	* This was a minor API change

2007-10-31  Alberto Garcia Gonzalez <agarcia@igalia.com>

	* Ignore priority flags in tny_camel_msg_header_unset_flag()
	* Remove the X-Priority header in set_prio_mask() instead of
	tny_camel_msg_header_set_flag()

2007-10-31  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* \NoSelect folders should never get a STATUS request, fixed
	* Documentation clarification about priority and flags
	* Renamed tny_header_set_flags to set_flag, same for unset
	* Lowered the number of TOPs before incrementally filling up of the
	headers model happens for POP

	* This was a major API change

2007-10-30  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improvements to the AUTHORS file. Authors can obviously notify
	me if they want their description improven or removed.
	* Using the SSL negotiated timeout time for IDLE's recycle (undone)
	* Undone last timeout change, set it to 27 minutes fixed for IMAP

2007-10-29  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* Fix: now we don't unset the priority flag on setting or
	  unsetting other flags.

2007-10-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Introduction of tny_gtk_msg_window_set_view

	* This was a minor API change

2007-10-26  Alberto Garcia Gonzalez <agarcia@igalia.com>

2007-10-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* X-Priority flag writing fixed

2007-10-25  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Corrections for the priority flags
	* Memory leak fix in CamelImapCommand, found by Dirk-Jan
	* Freeing of recursive locks, especially the ones that we allocated
	ourselves

	* This was a major API change

2007-10-24  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improvements for the IDLE support. The Nonblocking read is now
	actually used correctly, various racy situations should be fixed now
	and instant event throwing is put in place (during IDLE state).
	* Removed the (*read_idle) funcptr from CamelTcpStream, as this is no longer
	required. This to reduce the complexity of the IDLE patch so that we
	can later, perhaps, more easily bring this feature to upstream Camel.
	* Updating unread and total count if necessary (due to IDLE events)
	* Fixed the normal-priority flag ni Maildir

2007-10-23  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Reference count problem in TnyCamelHeader
	* priv->folder_name in TnyCamelFolder sometimes is NULL, which
	doesn't seem right (and is racy).
	* Improvements for the IDLE support. The Nonblocking read is now
	actually used correctly, various racy situations should be fixed now
	and instant event throwing is put in place (during IDLE state).
	* Removed the (*read_idle) funcptr from CamelTcpStream, as this is no longer
	required. This to reduce the complexity of the IDLE patch so that we
	can later, perhaps, more easily bring this feature to upstream Camel.

2007-10-19  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Avoiding the second capability request, eliminating roundtrips when
	connecting. If LOGIN returns a capability response, we assume this one
	is complete enough to continue. The AUTH= ones are not relevant
	anymore as we've authenticated anyway (most IMAP servers don't include
	the AUTH= capabilities in the LOGIN's response).
	* Restarting IDLE when needed
	* Restoring the selected folder if possible after a reconnect
	* Reverted camel-operation.c to rev 2823 for my good friend Sergio
	* Locking issue, fix is experimental
	* A fix for normal CONDSTORE

2007-10-18  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Operation notifactions no longer wait for 4 seconds to group them
	together. This is experimental. Uncomment line 620 of
	camel-operation.c to undo this.
	* Added a -DMERGEFOLDERTEST that will perform a test for
	TnyMergeFolder
	* Implemented a small test that makes it possible to transfer messages
	from one folder to another using the demoui
	* Removed a few invalid assertions
	* Unread count upon IDLE events
	* Implemented QRESYNC for IMAP4 servers that already implement it:
	http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lemonade-reconnect-client-06
	* Unread count problems with TnyMergeFolder
	* Removed use of strcasestr, replaced with own implementation
	* non-case sensitivity of IMAP responses
	* Various memory problem fixes

2007-10-17  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Made sure that the standard Maildir format also works (with the ':'
	as flag separator character). The standard for Tinymail, though, is to
	use the '!' character (fallback when reading is ':').
	* Made the sizes of Maildir E-mails more accurate (using stat())

2007-10-17  Vivek Sekar  <viveksekar@gmail.com>

	* Added microb-engine-dev and changed the debug architecture to 'any'
	in debian/control.maemo1.

2007-10-16  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed regression on the regression fix of a few days ago :)
	* Renamed Maildir filenames to have '!' instead of '_' or ':' in
	their filenames

2007-10-15  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* Some fixes to mozembed build.
	* Disable mozembed packages build in maemo.

2007-10-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Regression on yesterday's summary related patch. Fixed
	* Regression on yesterday's mime part parser patch. Fixed

2007-10-11  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* iconv error situation handler
	* Bugfix when the summary file was not yet created for a Maildir

2007-10-10  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* m4/moz.m4: add support for gtkmozembed library using gtkembedmoz.pc.
	Also export mozilla_home.
	* debian/rules.maemo: compile with mozembed support.
	* debian/control.maemo1: compile with mozembed support.
	* tests/c-demo/tny-main.c: remove mozilla calls in main.
	* configure.ac: some fixes for html module detection. Use mozilla home.
	Now we only use detection of xpcom for being sure we've got an engine
	path.
	* Removed libtinymailui-mozembed/mozilla-preferences.{cpp,h}, as we now
	use gtk moz embed api to set preferences.
	* libtinymalui-mozembed/Makefile.am: removed mozilla preferences from
	build.
	* libtinymailui-mozembed/tny-moz-embed-html-mime-part-view.c:
	Now we use gtk moz embed to set preferences. We also set properly the
	component path (mozilla home from used engine), and the profile path
	(using the progname). We set a default chrome without scrollbars.

2007-10-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Merged camel-mime-utils.c with uptream Camel

2007-10-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Backported a patch from Niels Christens on Camel to Camel-Lite. The
	patch fixed the behaviour when the server expects a TLS HELLO, while
	SSL version 2 is used.
	* Merged camel-lite with upstream Camel revision 8099
	* Merged bugfix from Matthew Barnes. More information here:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=437331
	* Changed the address of FSF in the copyright notes
	* Further merging upstream Camel with camel-lite

2007-10-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	- -Wall warnings
	- -pedantic warnings
	- TnyCamelSendQueue should not error if the TnyDevice went offline
	- Bugfixes in TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel

2007-10-03  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c:
	(tny_merge_folder_get_id): fixed id generation. We
	were setting this with a fixed value always due to
	an error in initialisation. Now we calculate an
	id with the merged folder id's and their account
	id's.
	(tny_merge_folder_get_url_string): created
	implementation. Now it gets the merge folder id
	as part of the url string with this format:
	"merge://ID"

2007-09-28  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Unsigned integers can't be < 0

2007-09-26  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-common.c,
	(_foreach_email_add_to_inet_addr): now we don't use
	strtok_r() to split the string to addresses, as we
	weren't taking into account the quotes. I implemented
	a new _split_recipients() method that takes quotes
	into account.
	(_string_to_camel_inet_addr): now we remove the quotes
	in the name part of an address, as they are added by
	camel part automatically.

2007-09-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed (avoided) a memory leak in saving CamelObject's states
	* Sending messages, some fixes for the CC and BCC fields
	* Date-Received on maildir was foobar

2007-09-25  Mark Doffman <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	from the automatically generated bindings.

	* /bindings/python/README: Update for changes to the way
	the python bindings are generated.

	iterator, platform factory, and account store. Update the
	svn ignore to ignore the compiled python files.

	* /tests/python-demo/tinymail-python-test.py: Modify to use
	the python implementation of the platform factory.

2007-09-24  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	in tny_gtk_header_list_model_set_folder and additions
	to the tinymail library.

	* bindings/python/Makefile.am: Added a generated file to
	the CLEANFILES to fix release problems.

2007-09-18  Sergio Villar Senín  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: fixed an issue when
	transferring folders, the CamelFolderInfo of the parent of the folder
	that is moved is now NULLized.

2007-09-18  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a possible crash when renaming folders

2007-09-17  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/local/camel-maildir-folder.c:
	Add implementation of method rewrite_cache for maildir,
	so that we can implement also purge in maildir.

2007-09-17  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added callback, status_callback and user_data to
	tny_gtk_header_list_model_set_folder
	* Added a canceled parameter to the TnyCamelSetOnlineCallback

	* This was a major API change

2007-09-17  Mark Doffman  <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	* /bindings/python/gendefs/defsgen.py:
	Modify so that only non-virtual methods can be
	generated.

	* /bindings/python/gendefs/Makefile.am:
	Generate virtual method definitions for Tinymail
	and Tinymailui libraries.

	* /bindings/python/*.defs: Include virtual method
	definitions. All Tinymail and Tinymailui interfaces
	are implementable.

	* /bindings/python/*.override: I add type definitions
	to fix bindings compilation problems when used with
	updated .defs files.

2007-09-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* TnyCamelSendQueue's sent-msg signal emission (some corrections)
	* Small locking problem when requesting the unread-count of a
	TnyCamelFolder
	* Disconnecting the old settings if new settings are set and
	tny_camel_account_set_online is issued (experimental)
	* Crash fixes when alerting

2007-09-13  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c: Remove assertion that expects folder
	names to have 1 character at least (at least in my IMAP server
	we've got empty strings as valid imap folders).

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header-priv.h: Add internal API
	to set a decorated header (at least for updating flag values).

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header.c: Now we can set an
	internal decorated TnyHeader instance. For flags operations,
	we'll set/unset/get also the decorated header.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-partial-msg-receive-strategy.c: Now
	we set the folder header as decorated by the msg header. This way
	the flags are set correctly in folder when we set a flag from the
	header obtained from the message.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-full-msg-receive-strategy.c: Now we
	set the folder header as decorated by the msg header.


2007-09-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Unread count improvements for IMAP folders
	* Unread count improvements for POP folders
	* Marking messages that can't be found anymore as expunged on POP

	crashers)
	* Error handling and reporting when the filesystem is full
	* Counting unread items was wrong, fixed
	* Introduction of tny_camel_folder_get_full_name
	* Removal of tny_camel_folder_get_folder

	* This was a minor API change

2007-09-06  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: fixed a problem in the
	notification of a folder removal that could cause a SIGSEV when
	deleting a tree of folders with messages.

2007-09-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed folder renames for local folders
	* Fixed a bug about keeping folders open

2007-09-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.h: Change the
	TnyCamelGetSupportedSecureAuthCallback callback to provide a
	GError* instead of a GError**, because it is not an output parameter.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c: (on_supauth_idle),
	(tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication_async_thread
	), (tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication):
	Adapt to the change, propagating GErrors up to the callback.

2007-09-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a problem when folder creation failed: observers where
	nevertheless notified about a folder creation in this case

2007-09-04  Mark Doffman  <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	* bindigs/python/*: restructuring the Python language bindings

2007-09-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(tny_camel_account_set_url_string_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_name_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_id_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_secure_auth_mech_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_proto_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_user_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_hostname_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_port_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_pass_func_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_forget_pass_func_default): Check that the input
	is differnt to the existing value, to avoid unnecessarily signalling that
	the account has changed.

2007-09-04  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Fixed bug in update folder observers call, creating
	the new change object to propagate it to observers.

2007-09-04  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: fixed the default function
	used to implement the get_local_size interface

2007-09-04  Vivek Sekar  <viveksekar@gmail.com>

	* Added AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(.) to
	libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/configure.ac : fixes a maemo integration
	build error.

2007-09-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a possible race condition in CamelMultiPart
	* Fixed thread stack leakage on threads that are joinable but never
	joined
	* Major changes in TnyFolderStoreQuery and TnyFolderStoreQueryItem.
	Support for non-regular expression matches and case insensitive
	matching added.

	* This was a major API change

2007-09-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a filedescriptor leak when there are no items in a folder, on
	summary.mmap
	* Changed the Copyright of tny-vfs-stream.c: the original is not
	really recognizable anymore so it shouldn't copy the copyright of the
	original as this is not a copy anymore.
	* Date, Received, INTERNALDATE: fixes
	* Fixed filedescriptor leaks with local folders
	* Fixed online command attempts when password got cancelled
	* Fixed a deadlock when sending failed
	* Fixed some things in TnyCamelSendQueue
	* Removed a unnecessary API

	* This was a major API change

2007-09-03  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Add a new API function, tny_send_queue_add_async to define
	user and status callbacks for messages transfer to outbox
	folder.

2007-09-03  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.[ch]: added two new functions
	tny_merge_folder_remove_folder
	tny_merge_folder_get_folders

	This is a major API change

2007-08-29  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c
	(tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication_async_thread):
	Call the prepare_func vfunc before asking camel to ask the server for
	auth types so priv->service is set.

2007-08-31 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Fix tny_camel_msg_header_date_(sent|received):
		- don't try to normalize to GMT (camel already does that)
		- only use Date: for received if not received date is found
	* don't try to disconnect from conic if the IAP == NULL, as that
	  causes a segfault

2007-08-29 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Set the correct X-Priority: header values, and parse the correct
	  as well (1 (Highest), 2 (High), 3 (Normal), 4 (Low), 5 (Lowest))

2007-08-28  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Added a new API function in TnyFolder class: tny_folder_remove_msgs.
  	This function allows to remove several messages in a single camel
	operation, avoiding to call excesive times to folder observer
	notification.

2007-08-15  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Reading dnsmasq's resolv.conf files to know whether or not we are
	initially online or not in libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_offline): Fix a compiler warning
	about an unused variable.

2007-08-15  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improved the TnyMaemoConicDevice a bit
	* Making TnyMaemoConicDevice wait five seconds before proxing the
	emission of a connection-change as a Tinymail signal. It seems that
	there are various states of "being online" for Conic. You are quite
	early notified of being online: sometimes before the dhcp client
	managed to fill-in resolv.conf, causing hostname lookup failures as
	Tinymail as soon as possible tried to go online. With the five seconds
	delay we are hoping that the device will have setup all right by the
	time Tinymail attempts to go online. Please monitor this behaviour in
	future and review carefully.

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init): Change the is_online default
	to TRUE.
	* This is a hack that fixes a problem
	* (Our signal is not emitted before the gtk mainloop is started,
	* because we use an idle handler for that and we don't know how to
	* detect when the mainloop has not yet started.
	* The downside is that we now don't know that we are really offline,
	* so we can't ask the user to go online.
	* This must be fixed properly.

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c: (conic_emit_status):
	Do not check for a running mainloop, because we know of no working
	way to do this, and it causes hangs if we never use the idle handler.
	See the comments in the code.

2007-08-15  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Moved the conic tests to a subdirectory

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(conic_emit_status_idle), (conic_emit_status):
	If no mainloop is running (for instance, before gtk_main_run()),
	just emit without using g_idle_add(). Hopefully this will cause the signal
	to be emitted early enough - when tinymail needs is_online() to be correct.
	See the comments to see why this is OK for tinymail.

2007-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap):
	Fixed a compiler warnings and a build fix when building for the device.

2007-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init): Initialize is_online before
	forcing the on_connection_event() signal handler to be called, not after,
	which could explain why is_online sometimes seems to be false at the start
	when it should not be.

2007-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_transfer_msgs_default): Remove unused err variable
	to fix a compiler warning.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c: Formatting/syntax
	changes requested by Philip.

2007-08-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Recursively removing local directories
	* Smaller bugfixes and performance improvements
	* Enhanced error reporting in the async operations
	* Dealing with certain states (where priv->folder is uninitialized) in
	the async operations
	* Moving observer notifies away from transfer-msgs
	* Moved the io_lock a bit tighter for CamelStoreSummary

	* tests/c-demo/tny-demoui-summary-view.c:
	(on_header_view_tree_row_activated):
	Avoid compiler warnings, such as unused variables, functions without
	returns, and unused functions. Tinymail now builds with -Wall -Werror
	again.

2007-08-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improvements in notifying the observers when removing folders
	* Improvements when deleting items
	* When deleting items from a POP, notifying observers
	* Detecting remotely removed objects on POP
	* Not using the too high level subscribe API (which causes unrequired
	signal emissions)
	* Fixed a few memory problems in TnyCamelStoreAccount

2007-08-10  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Enhancements in the POP code, when removing and expunging items

2007-08-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Some improvements when getting a folder list

2007-08-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Code cleanups in TnyCamelSendQueue
	* Introduction of tny_folder_add_msg_async
	* Better handling of offline (because service is unavailable) cases
	* Making TnySessionCamel's maildir folders behave a bit better
	* Using tny_folder_add_msg_async in tny_camel_send_queue_add_default

	* This was a major API change

2007-08-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Consistency in the async callback APIs
	* Cleaning up in case of cancels
	* Making sync_async cancellable
	* Error reporting fixes

	* This was a major API change

2007-08-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* GDK lock awareness
	* More conservatism about reconnecting
	* Fixed a few locking problems with POP
	* Callbacks and destroynotifies of cancelled-removed items
	* Fetching of folders happens in a queue item now

2007-08-02  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Reintroduction of cancellation support (this is experimental)
	* Timezone fix in the summary (remove your caches)
	* Making tny_account_cancel actually work, or at least a little bit
	better than before this commit (cleaning up the queue a bit)

2007-08-01  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Reconnect hang fix
	* Invalid cancelled warning fix
	* Tryout fix (I know this doesn't sound very promising) for password questions
	on the mainloop (POP can cause this, in case of an auth error during
	sync operation's reconnect)
	* Added the changed signal to TnyAccount
	* Making tny_account_set_name get propagated to the TnyGtkFolderStore-
	TreeModel instance.
	* Fixed a kludge in the TnySessionCamel for POP accounts with wrong
	passwords

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-31  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Introduction of tny_folder_get_headers_async
	* Adaptation of TnyGtkHeaderListModel to use the new API

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-31  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Merging back devel/pvanhoof/sessionwork to trunk/

2007-07-31  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Cleaning up, coding style fixes
	* Review of TnyCamelFolder and TnyCamelStoreAccount

2007-07-30  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Various fixes that make Modest actually work with this

2007-07-30  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Fixed some bugs in TnyMergeFolder notification function. This
        method was overwriting data into old change, rather than use the
	new_change structure to propagate changes to observed folders.

        * Fixed bug in TnyCamelSendQueue related with msg-sent signal
	emision. Now, when an error has detected, msg-sent is not emited.

2007-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-mime-parser.c: (folder_scan_content),
	(folder_scan_step): Initialize some variables because
	valgrind complains about uninitialized variables here. This does not
	fix it but it should make things clearer for someone who can fix it.

2007-07-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Merged tny-camel-folder.c with devel/sessionwork's version
	* This moves the poke-status operations to the account's queue
	* Merged camel-pop3-engine.c with devel/sessionwork's version
	* This fixes a locking problem while disconnecting the POP account

	* Merging the Cond patch from devel/sessionwork

2007-07-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* The long awaited alert, get_pass and forget_pass now in the mainloop

	* This was a major API and behaviour change

2007-07-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a race condition when the account was or is connection or not
	yet finished connecting while the connection-status-changed signal was
	already being used. Introduced a new API for this
	* Introduced the tny_account_is_ready API, which indicates when an
	account is not only valid as instance, but also fully registered
	within the system.
	* Implemented some missing implementations in TnyCombinedAccount

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Dealing with remotely removed folders
	* The poke status calls are now on the same queue as the other
	operations
	* Rewritten the TnySessionCamel infrastructure that connects accounts
	and sets them up
	* Added support for detecting folder changes to
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel
	* API change on tny_camel_account_set_online. The last argument is now
	a callback rather than a GError. In the callback you can know about
	when the account got connected and if not, why it failed

	* Cond locks in the queues of the store accounts while the callbacks
	are happening. This is a significant policy change in locking
	behaviour that should be well tested.

	* This was a major API change in TnyAccount

2007-07-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Branchpoint "devel/sessionwork"

2007-07-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* More granularity in the locking of the POP code
	* Several fixes in the POP code
	* Folder renaming for local folders

2007-07-25  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Various locking improvements in the POP code
	* Parallel retrieval of messages
	* Disconnecting after summary retrieval of a POP folder
	* Disconnecting after get-msg and sync of a POP folder
	* Some reference counting problems when factoring folders

2007-07-24  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Preparing for a release candidate
	* Added skeleton for webkit support
	* Restructuring the internal API for async methods a bit
	* Experimental lining up of async functions in one thread

2007-07-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c: Improved the
	documentation for tny_camel_account_set_online().

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c: (tny_merge_folder_get_id),
	(tny_merge_folder_instance_init): Use
	unknown_mergefolder instead of an empty string for the default ID,
	because an empty string is not allowed by the get_func_id() DBC
	contract, causing a crash at runtime when DBC is enabled in the build.

2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	(camel_imap_recon): if there's no reconnection operation, then we don't
	call it, preventing crashes.

2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c:
	(imap_refresh_info): now we lock the folder also, before locking the
	service, in order to respect better the lock order. This should avoid
 	some locks.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.[ch]:
	now we store a reference to the struct addrinfo used for connections. When
	we are successful getting a valid addrinfo, it's stored and reused. This
	way we prevent doing lots of calls to getaddrinfo and subsequent name
	resolutions. As we're currently blocking while name resolution is running,
	this should make the application more reponsive in general and avoid
	flooding the connection.
	We also removed the method (camel_imap_service_connect) as it's not used.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-private.h:
 	added parenthesis to some lock macros.

2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: protect a folder lock
	with a reason. This prevents some interlock problems, as the
	last unreason can lead to a folder lock.

2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	(tny_camel_mime_part_get_parts_default): improve detection
	of attached messages, as we need to create a proper TnyMsg
	object when the attachment is a message.
	(tny_camel_mime_part_add_part_default): now when we are
	attaching a message as a part, it's created adding a
	message/rfc822 mime part that contains the message as
	its content object. This fixes attaching messages.

2007-07-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Allowing the POP code to do RETRs while the TOPs are working (while
	summary is being retrieved, allow the POP code to receive messages
	already)
	* Avoiding a join in the mainloop
	* Reconnecting and connection failing for POP, in case of connection
	problems

2007-07-12  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* Added a new parameter to the constructor of a merge folder which is
	the name of the new merge folder

	* This is a major API change

2007-07-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed the POP unread count problems

2007-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(tny_camel_account_matches_url_string_default): For maildir accounts,
	compare their paths before the # marker for the folder, to avoid
	considering all maildir accounts to be the same account.

2007-07-11  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: Recreate folder list
	after a new folder has been created so that subsequent calls to
	_get_folder() contain the newly created folder.

2007-07-11 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>
	* Don't set subject to 'No Subject' if it's empty
	(camel-mime-message.c)

2007-07-09  Javier Fernández García-Boente <jfernandez@igalia.com>
	* Implements and emits msg-sending and msg-sent signals
	when a message is just being sent and when is fully sent.
        * Add a notification about EXPUNGED header change in
	tny_camel_folder_remove_msg_default method.

2007-07-10  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Made the connecting of accounts more finegrained (once more)
	* Introduced the required tny_session_camel_set_initialized API
	* Preserving flags on POP

	* This was a major change in behaviour when connecting and at
	initialization
	* This was a major API change

2007-07-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.h: alert_func vfunc:
	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.c: (tny_account_store_alert):

	(tny_olpc_account_store_alert):
	* tests/shared/account-store.c: (tny_test_account_store_alert):
	Add a TnyAcccount* parameter to the alert_func vfunc, so that
	applications an show information about the account (and server)
	that failed. This is documented as sometimes being NULL for current
	implementations (see the *ssl.c comment below).

	* camel/camel-session.h:
	* camel/camel-session.c: (camel_session_alert_user),
	(camel_session_alert_user_with_id),
	(camel_session_alert_user_generic): Added a CamelService*
	paramteter to these functions. For tinymail, this allows us to use
	CamelService::data to get the TnyAccount*.
	* camel/camel-disco-diary.c: (camel_disco_diary_log),
	(diary_decode_folder):
	* camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c:

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c: (ssl_verify):
	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-ssl.c: (ssl_bad_cert): Pass NULL for
	service_user_data because I cannot see a suitable CamelService.
	See the TODOs.

2007-07-10  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added the tny_folder_get_local_size API
	* Fixed the folder deletion of maildir folders
	* Added the get_local_size implementation to TnyMergeFolder
	* Implementing missing implementation of sync_async in TnyMergeFolder

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: 
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: (tny_error_get_type):
	Added TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_USER_CANCEL 
	and TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_USER_CANCEL.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(_tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id):
	Handle CAMEL_EXCEPTION_USER_CANCEL as 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_USER_CANCEL, so that applications 
	can ignore this.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-transport-account.c:
	(get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id):
	Likewise, handle as CAMEL_EXCEPTION_USER_CANCE as 
	TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_USER_CANCEL.

2007-07-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added the tny_folder_sync_async method. Boutifully paradoxical by
	name!

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Changed the cache-dir locations to ones that are more suitable for
	mor types of filesystems
	* Added the user to IMAP cache-dir locations

2007-07-09  Javier Fernández García-Boente <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Change way to manage priority flags (2 bits) 
        on maildir folders. Now, HIGH_PRIORITY flag
	will be used as bit mask to extract priority flags
	and compare them with specific bits flag.

2007-07-09  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	(tny_camel_mime_part_get_parts): now, if the mime part is a
	multipart/related, it sets the content disposition of the children
	to inline for parts that didn't get a disposition before. This
	should improve handling of inline attached images.

2007-07-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: (tny_error_get_type):
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h:
	Added TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_HOST_LOOKUP_FAILED, 
	TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, 
	TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_AUTHENTICATION_NOT_SUPPORTED
	GError enum values.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-transport-account.c:
	Added get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id(),
	(tny_camel_transport_account_send_default): Provide a 
	more specific GError code to the caller, so that this will 
	be provided with the TnySendQueue "error-happened" signal.
	(tny_camel_transport_account_try_connect): 
	Use _tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id() 
	here to provide a more specific error code.

2007-07-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improvement for tny_camel_mime_part_is_attachment_default
	* Deleting non-empty folders of a maildir
	* Unread and seen counts are (or should be) unrelated
	* The tny_account_set_pass_func must now always be the last to set

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Yet another attempt at fixing the namespace problem (empty root
	folders)
	* Fixed a disconnect at startup (temporary fix)
	* Fixed a problem when creating folders (found by Armin Burgmeier)

2007-07-08  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Temporary empty root folder fix

2007-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: (tny_error_get_type):
	Added TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_CERTIFICATE and documented the enum 
	values that I added last time.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(_tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id):
	Handle CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SERVICE_CERTIFICATE as TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_CERTIFICATE.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c:
	(tny_session_camel_alert_user): Adapt signature, as follows.
	Also handle the CAMEL_EXCEPTION_USER_CANCEL error ID instead of checking the message text. 

	* camel/camel-exception-list.def: Added CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SERVICE_CERTIFICATE.
	* camel/camel-session.h:
	* camel/camel-session.c: (camel_session_alert_user): Take a CamelException 
	instead of a message, so we don't lose the error ID sometimes.
	(camel_session_alert_user_with_id),
	(camel_session_alert_user_generic): Convenience functions to use when 
	no CamelException is available.

	* camel/providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: (smtp_connect):
	Use the exception instead of just the message with camel_session_alert_user(), 
	so that the application has the error code. 

	* camel/camel-disco-diary.c: (camel_disco_diary_log),
	(diary_decode_folder):
	* camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c:
	(camel_imap_command_response), (camel_imap_command_response_idle):
	* camel/providers/imap4/camel-imap4-engine.c:
	(camel_imap4_engine_parse_resp_code):
	* camel/providers/imap4/camel-imap4-summary.c:
	(courier_imap_is_a_piece_of_shit): Use camel_session_alert_user_generic() 
	instead of camel_session_alert_user(), because we have no ID or exception here.

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c: (ssl_verify):
	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-ssl.c: (ssl_bad_cert): Use the new 
	CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SERVICE_CERTIFICATE error ID here. There are still many different 
	types of certificate error, but this at least classifies them a bit.

2007-07-05  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c: When propagating a TnyFolderChange
	notified from one of the underlaying folders, do copy that
	TnyFolderChange and set the changed folder of that copy to the merge
	folder. Also, do not propagate folder renames because the merge folder
	itself has not been renamed.

2007-07-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a crasher when transferring messages

2007-07-06  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header.c:
	(tny_camel_msg_header_set_flags, tny_camel_msg_header_get_flags,
	tny_camel_msg_header_unset_flags): added support to store and
	retrieve the TNY_HEADER_FLAG_ATTACHMENTS.

2007-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: Added 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_HOST_LOOKUP_FAILED, 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE and 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_AUTHENTICATION_NOT_SUPPORTED so 
	that the TnyAccountStore::alert_func() callback can sometimes get 
	more specific information, so that it doesn't need to just blindly show 
	the camel internal error message.
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: Updated tny_error_get_type(), though this should be 
	generated code as in GTK+.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account-priv.h:
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	Added _tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id() for 
	choosing a suitable tinymail GError code.
	(_tny_camel_account_try_connect), (_tny_camel_account_set_online):
	Use a specific error code for the GErrors.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c:
	(tny_session_camel_alert_user): Add a TODO noting that this is where we 
	lose some specific error codes, and where we do a dodgy string comparison 
	on the message text.

	* camel/camel-exception-list.def: Added a 
	CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SYSTEM_HOST_LOOKUP_FAILED error code enum value.
	* camel/camel-net-utils.c: (camel_getaddrinfo):
	Use the new error code when appropriate.

2007-07-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added some non standard flags to the maildir support
	* Support for suspended items in sendqueues
	* Fixed an API glitch in TnyFolderChange
	* Empty folder bugfix
	* Added a guard to tny_mime_part_set_filename for NULL situations

2007-07-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixes for the new headers after a transfer of messages happened
	* Fixed for new headers after adding a message happened

2007-07-05  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	The asynchronous operations now always call the callbacks in an idle
	if the GMainLoop is available, even if the thread could not be
	started.
	Refactored the code that invokes the user callbacks.
	Changed the priority of the idles, now the status callbacks have
	higher priority than the function callbacks.
	
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c:
	The asynchronous operations now always call the callbacks in an idle
	if the GMainLoop is available, even if the thread could not be
	started.

2007-07-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Renamed removed to expunged in TnyFolderChange

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Dealing with the first connection status of the device instance
	* Several race conditions when rapidly connecting and disconnecting

2007-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Changed the check for a NULL iap
	(though it should have worked already) to ensure that the signal 
	is always emitted at initialization.
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_online): Do not just return if we 
	are in scratchbox. Nothing here is libconic-specific. This 
	makes is_online() return the correct value after calling force_online().

2007-07-04  Johannes Schmid <johannes.schmid@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c:
	Added API doc

2007-07-04  Johannes Schmid <johannes.schmid@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.[ch]:
	Added tny_merge_folder_set_folder_type() API to be able
	to assign a different folder type to a tny-merger-folder

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Implementation of tny_folder_poke_status for the total count of a
	POP folder

2007-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Move this to before the first use.
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_is_online): Put use of on_dummy_connection_check() 
	in an ifdef to avoid a linker failure.

2007-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Set is_online here instead of waiting for it to be 
	set in the signal, becacuse this is used to do a quick check without waiting for the timout 
	to check the file.
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_is_online): In the dummy scratchbox implementation, call 
	on_dummy_connection_check() before returning is_online, so that it is accurate.

	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Don't use libconic at all if we are in scratchbox, 
	because it signals that there is no connection, which confuses our dummy implementation.

2007-07-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Total count of POP3 folders
	* Thread joining between the TnyCamelSendQueue and the TnySessionCamel
	connection threads
	* Error handling in TnyMergeFolder

2007-07-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Bugfix in TnyCamelTransportAccount's prepare method
	* Fixing up the TnyCamelSendQueue's at-connect
	* Bugfix in renaming on IMAP
	* Improved the granularity of the is_connected flag
	* Bugfixed a crasher at perform_content_info_save in
	CamelFolderSummary
	* Fixed a bug in case From addresses become excessively long
	* Bugfix when transferring messages (folder observers getting the
	right TnyHeader instances)
	* Fixed a lock when setting headers while fetching summary
	* Bugfix when tny_camel_account_set_online was called from the
	mainloop

2007-07-02  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed a bug in Maildir when setting flags
	* Fixed empty-string folders at root's level on IMAP
	* Fixed blocking reads and writes in camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c,
	camel-tcp-stream-raw.c (camel-file-utils.c) and camel-tcp-stream-nss.c
	* Fixed a IDLE-stop problem when renaming a folder

2007-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect): When using scratchbox, show an 
	OK/Cancel dialog and write a fake connection name to the text file, 
	to simulate what libconic does on the device.
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Interpret 'none' in the text file as 
	meaning no connection. This leaves an empty file as defaulting to 
	a meaning of connection debugid0. (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_
	current_iap_id): Return NULL if the iap is 'none', when in scratchbox.

2007-07-02  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fallback for BINARY
	* Fallback for UIDPLUS
	* Added a check for the session in TnyCamelTransportAccount
	* Bugfix when finalizing an account
	* Removed some old internal hooks-API

2007-07-01  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed/updated the Python bindings
	* Fixed the gtk-doc API documentation genation process
	* Updated the online gtk-doc API documentation
	* Prepared a testing QEmu virtual machine
	* Marked the Kolumbus IMAP server as an idiot's IMAP server, as it
	doesn't correctly support UIDPLUS and BINARY

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_connect):
	Removed debug output.

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect): Use GDK_THREADS_ENTER/LEAVE as 
	used by gdk_dialog_run(), because a second g_main_loop_run() seems 
	to hang when gdk_threads_init() has been called before (by the app, 
	for instance). I don't like having these at this level, so we 
	should try to fix it properly later.

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c: 
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_connect):
	Use a second mainloop instead of iterating the main mainloop. This 
	seems more robust and is probably the recommended way to do it.
	There is lots of debug output here, which I will remove later after 
	further investigations.

2007-06-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Bugfix in TnyCamelTransportAccount: rewrote the prepare method
	implementation

2007-06-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Various connectivity bugfixes
	* Fixed a locking problem when connectivity changes

	* Slowing down the STATUS commands
	* Detecting connection changes with the connection_status_changed
	signal on TnyAccount
	* Multiple fixes when reconnecting
	* Initial folder-list when starting the application offline

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-mess
	age-cache.c: (camel_imap_message_cache_replace_with_wrapper):
	Comment out unused variables to prevent warnings.
	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-mess
	age-cache.h: Actually declare 
	camel_imap_message_cache_replace_with_wrapper(), to avoid a warning 
	in came-imap-folder.c.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Add a debug printf here in case 
	this is the cause of disconnections.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.h:
	Do not include some unnecessary libconic headers. 
	* tests/test-device-conic.c: New test.

2007-06-27  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	These changes add support for purging specific attachments 
	from cache, with an implementation in the IMAP backend. This
	is a major API change.

	* libtinymail/tny-msg.[ch]:
	(tny_msg_rewrite_cache): added new method to rewrite cache
	and expunge purged attachments if supported.

	* libtinymail/tny-mime-part.[ch]:
	(tny_mime_part_is_purged, tny_mime_part_set_purte): added two
	methods that mark a mime part to be purged in cache (in
	storages that support this).

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_rewrite_cache): new method that calls
	the new Camel rewrite cache api for a message.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.[ch]:
	implementation of tny_mime_part_is_purged and
	tny_mime_part_set_purged, to mark parts to be purged
	in IMAP.

	(imap_rewrite_cache): new method that rewrites the cache representation
	of a message purging attachments marked to be purged.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/camel-imap-message-cache.[ch]:
	(camel_imap_message_cache_replace_with_wrapper): replaces the cache
	entry for a message with a new representation from wrapper. This should
	purge attachments marked as purge, in collaboration with mime part.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-folder.[ch]:
	(rewrite_cache): added default empty implementation and virtual.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-mime-part.c:
	now, if message disposition is "purged", output for the attachment is
	disabled. This should let user purge attachments on recaching.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg.[ch]:
	(tny_camel_msg_rewrite_cache_default, tny_camel_msg_rewrite_cache): implementation
	of rewrite method using camel new methods to rewrite cache.

2007-06-27  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	Fixed an issue when removing folders. Fixed some issues when moving
	folders, the priv->iter of the camel folders was not correctly created
	so they do not have the right pointers to their children, parents and
	siblings. NOTE that this is a risky patch, not completely tested.

2007-06-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Several memory fixes, based on Valgrind error and warning reporting

2007-06-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	(tny_camel_msg_header_get_flags): added implementation
	that obtains the priority flags using the headers
	we set in our set/unset methods.
	(tny_camel_msg_header_set_flags, tny_camel_msg_header_set_flags):
	fixed the check for only allowing priority flags to be set or
	unset.
	
	* libtinymail-tests/tny-header-test.c: added unit test for
	priority flags in camel msg header.

2007-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	(tny_camel_folder_find_msg_default): Do not require UIDs to be longer than 
	1 character.

2007-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/test-conic.c: Added a simple test case to show

	http://tinymail.org/trac/tinymail/ticket/66

2007-06-18  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed the From and the Error reporting when sending messages
	* Fixed the support for Yahoo's SMTP
	* Added some more information to the error-happened signal for
	TnySendQueue

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-17  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Increased read-idle's low timeout times: now that all IDLE happens in
	a thread, it's not necessary anymore to quickly unblock.
	* Code cleanups
	* Connection timeout corrections
	* Read, Read-idle, Read-nonblock timeout corrections
	* Introduction of tny_account_start_operation and

2007-06-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed some flag values

2007-06-14  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	(tny_camel_mime_part_add_part_default): now, if the
	CamelMimePart has a multipart content type already,
	it's used as the content type of the data wrapper
	if it's created. This way we can create different
	kinds of multiparts in tinymail.
	(tny_camel_mime_part_construct_from_stream_default):
	if the mime part is a message (mime type is
	message/rfc822) then instead of instanciating a
	plain data wrapper, it instanciates a
	CamelMimeMessage. This should prevent problems
	on adding these mime parts to a message or
	mime part.

2007-06-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* The cache size of local folders, feature implementation

	(tny_camel_account_matches_url_string_default):
	Actually set the in variable so that the comparison actually happens.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_find_msg_default): Skip over the / before, not after 
	checking for / at the start. Do a g_warning() if the format is false, 
	to help debugging.

2007-06-13  Antia Puentes Felpeto  <apuentes@igalia.com>
	
	* Added a test in tests/functional that tests removing folders

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_get_url_string_default):
	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c:
	* libtinymail/tny-store-account.c: Added documentation and comments 
	about the url-string. Note that Philip fixed 
	tny_folder_get_url_string_default() in a previous commit.

2007-06-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added some extra locking into the camel-lite's POP3 code

2007-06-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added placeholder for future libtinymail-tp
	* This is unfinished material (don't yet use it)

2007-06-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improved the tny_folder_poke_status implementation of TnyCamelFolder
	(performance improvement, made it internally async)
	* Experimental caching of root folder list
	* Added some locking in the CamelPOP3Store and folder

2007-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h: Resynced the fake TnyFolderType enum values 
	from tnyfolder.h and added comments explaining why we have these fake 
	uninstalled enums for gtk-doc, with a link to the gtk-doc bug.
	
	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c:
	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: (updater),
	(deleter), (find_store_iter): Use TnyFolderType instead of gint when 
	using this column, and initialize it, rather than depending on 
	gtk_tree_model_get() to initialize it. The compiler can't detect these 
	possible unitialized uses.

2007-06-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Configurable idle delays
	* Configurable get-message service shutdown timeouts
	* Notifying the observers of a folder when a remove happens
	* Added tny_mime_part_set_header_pair

2007-06-11  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* The summary camel-lite code no longer puts the uid field in the mmap
	* Several race conditions fixed with the IDLE support
	* The IDLE support is no longer happening in a GMainLoop, but now in a
	thread. This so that the ui of applications on top of Tinymail wont
	hang with very high latency networks like GPRS (experimental)
	* Parallel fetching messages while you are retrieving summary
	(experimental)
	* Race condition fixes when expunged messages didn't get correctly
	removed (for whatever reason in the TnyFolderMonitor): more robust
	* Fixed some IDLE deadlocks
	* Added tny_camel_pop_store_account_reconnect
	* Bugfix for SSL support of camel-lite's SMTP provider

	* This was a minor API change

2007-06-08  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: Add the tree

	* libtinymail-camel: Fixed a problem when deleting folders that were
	just under an store account.
	* libtibymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: fixed a problem
	when notifying the observers when a folder was added just under an
	account

2007-06-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Merged camel-lite with upstream Camel revision 7777
	* Various connection cancellation problems fixed in the IMAP code
	* Fix for trac ticket #64
	* Fix for sergio, when removing folders the CamelFolderInfo iter was
	still cached
	* tny_folder_poke_status will now, for IMAP, do a STATUS command to
	more accurately find out the UNSEEN and MESSAGES statuses

2007-06-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed the OpenSSL support, although I'm leaving the warnings in
	place as the support for OpenSSL has not had as much testing as the
	Mozilla/NSS SSL implementations
	* Added the option --with-ssl=nss,openssl,none to the build to assist
	the SSL library availability detection
	* Changed the use_ssl options to "wrapped", "tls", "when-possible" and
	"never" for both POP3 and IMAP
	* Some connection fixes in the IMAP and POP3 connection procedures
	* Fixed the configure.ac of camel-lite, it had a small OpenSSL vs. NSS
	mixup

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-03  Johannes Schmid  <johannes.schmid@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication_async_thread
	Fixed implementation to get the secure authentication support
	methods and simplied them a lot.

2007-06-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Support for removing messages from a POP server after retrieval
	* Support for tny_header_get_uid on TnyMsg's header instance
	* Removed the warning in libtinymail/tny-folder.c: please use the
	support for DBC instead. It's specifically designed for this. Read
	the documentation in building.txt to find out how to enable it.

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_copy_shared): Initialize some variables 
	to avoid warnings.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-account-store.c:
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_store_account),
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_transport_account):
	Remove unused priv variables, to avoid warnings.

2007-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect): Block until the result is received by  	the on_connection_event() signal handler. This always seems to indicate 
	failure on Maemo Bora, but maybe it works properly in later versions.
	It is OK for this to block because the Maemo connection dialog is 
	totally modal anyway, and because most applications will not be able 
	to do anything sensible while waiting, because the user is already 
	waiting for an operation that he has initiated.

	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c: (tny_folder_get_all_count): Warn when this 
	is not implemented. Maybe not very necessary, but I seem to have had 
	this in my local checkout and maybe things crash without the check. 
	Can be removed later if you like.

2007-05-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed an error message when the account's status is offline and a
	cached version of a message is not available in tny_folder_get_msg and
	tny_folder_get_msg_async
	* Lowered the TCP and SSL timeouts

2007-05-29  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: replaced two wrong
	g_object_ref's by g_object_unref's in the copy_async implementation

2007-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Strip whitespace from the dummy account ID 
	found in the special file.
	
2007-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_current_iap_id),
	(on_dummy_connection_check),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Use a file 
	($HOME/maemo_conic_dummy_id) instead of an environment variable to 
	set the dummy ID when using scratchbox so we can check it for changes 
	every 1 second.
	
2007-05-28  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Experimental reuse of the get-message service for IMAP

2007-05-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* libtinymail-camel-tny-camel-send-queue.c: various locking fixes

2007-05-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap): When running in scratchbox, 
	make sure that this returns an instance for a more complete fake 
	implementation.

2007-05-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c:
	(recurse_folders_sync): Do not assume that the row instance is a 
	TnyFolderStore, because not all TnyFolders are TnyFolderStores. 
	This allows us to use this tree model with TnyMergeFolder.

2007-05-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c: (camel_mime_message_set_subject):
	Check that the input char* is not the same as the existing char*, 
	so we do not delete the input before using the input. This happens 
	when get_subject() is given directly to set_subject without a 
	g_strdup(), for instance.

2007-05-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c:
	(camel_tcp_stream_ssl_class_init): Add a g_warning() to warn people
	about using this unsupported alternative to NSS.

2007-05-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c: (socket_connect): When calling
	the standard connect () function, use sizeof (struct sockaddr) instead
	of just passing an uninitialized socklen_t, so that this can actually
	succeed, instead of failing with an Invalid Argument errno.

2007-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c: (camel_mime_message_set_subject):
	Prevent memory corruption. g_strstrip() does not return a newly
	allocated string. Also, camel_header_encode_string() doesn't seem to
	like being given NULL.

2007-05-22  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Shaped up the Unit tests
	* Fixed a bunch of -Wall warnings
	* Fixed some of the Design By Contract clausules

2007-05-21  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added a couple of new signals on TnyAccountStore and TnyAccount

2007-05-21 Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Use 'what' string parameter of asyn status callback to knonw 
	what operaiton is being executed, in oder to decide if progress
	data is send back or not.a

	* Add camel operation and progress call to 'folder_rename' operation.
	
2007-05-20  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* TnyAccountStore's alert_func has a 'question' parameter now

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-18  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

   	* folder was 'reason' unnecesary in copy_folder_async.
        * fix bug: g_error_free not neccesary after g_error_propagate

2007-05-17  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Recursively removing folders

2007-05-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list): When MAEMO_CONIC_DUMMY 
	hack together a list of fake debug* connection IDs as the result, 
	so we can simulate libconic in scratchbox.
	
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_current_iap_id): When MAEMO_CONIC_DUMMY, 
	return a fake debug* connection ID based on the value of a 
	MAEMO_CONIC_DUMMY_IAP_ID environment variable, so we can fake a 
	connection change (though the signal will not be emitted when the 
	environment variable changes.)
	
2007-05-16  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Removed the unworkable tny_folder_set_name, old code should replace
	this with tny_folder_copy with the del parameter set to TRUE and the
	folder store being the one you get using tny_folder_get_folder_store

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c:
	(tny_camel_store_account_prepare): Remove a warning that I shouldn't 
	have added in my last commit.

2007-05-16  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Some clarity for tny_folder_transfer_msgs in a GError for the
	developer who uses TnyHeader instances that came from
	tny_msg_get_header (he has to use the ones that he got from
	tny_folder_get_headers, not any others).

2007-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.h:
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	Added tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication(), 
	to get a list of strings for use with 
	tny_account_set_secure_auth_mech(), by querying the server. This is 
	async, providing the result via a callback.

	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: Added TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_GET_SUPPORTED_AUTH, 
	for use by tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication
	
	* This was a major API change

2007-05-16  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-queues/Makefile.am: install libtinymail-queues header
	files

2007-05-15  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* The new TnyQueue and TnyQueueTasks types
	* Major rewrites of libtinymail-queues
	* It's not stricly depending on AsyncWorker anymore
	* Introduction of libtinymail-asyncworker

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-queues
	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-asyncworker

2007-05-15  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* A new implementation for tny_folder_copy in libtinymail-camel
	* A new implementation for tny_folder_copy_async in libtinymail-camel
	* Changed the TnyCopyFolderCallback function description

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Waiting for the + continuation after IDLE
	* Please watch this fix with different IMAP implementations

2007-05-14  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

2007-05-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Improved connection / error handling when trying to connect fails
	* Merged camel-lite with camel-svn7713

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-11  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Implemented Rob's priv->stamp++ idea for removing things from an
	TnyGtkHeaderListModel

2007-05-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.c: tny_account_store_alert(): 
	Document that the vfunc might receive TNY_ACCOUNT_STORE_ERROR as well 
	as just TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR.
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: Document the TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT

	enhancement

2007-05-10  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: Added a new operation 
	tny_camel_folder_copy_async to copy one folder into other one using
	asynchronous operations.
	* libtinymail/tny-status.h: Added new status code for folder_copy_async
	callbacks.

	to a private type

	* This was a minor API change

2007-05-09  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am:
	Now Maemo target also compiles gnomevfs module.
	* debian/control.maemo:
	Added package for gnomevfs module

2007-05-08  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-queues/libtinymail-queues.pc.in: Fixed the name of the
	library in the -l option
	* Some ChangeLog fixes

2007-05-08  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c: Add cancelled parameter to 
	transfer_msgs_async function.
	* libtinymail/tny-shared.h: Change TransferMsgsAsync callback 
	API function.
	* libtinymail/tny-shared.h: Add a new status code for 
	transfer_msgs_async function.
	* ibtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c : Implementation of 
	status_callbacks calls in transfer_msgs_async function.

2007-05-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* -Wall warnings fixed

2007-05-08  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* make _finalize in tny-maemo-conic-device also do the dummy
	        disconnect, so we don't crash-on-exit in scratchbox

2007-05-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com

	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.c:
	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.h: Change the alert_func vfunc to 
	provide a GError instead of a human-readable error string.
	(tny_account_store_alert): The documentation for this vfunc invoker 
	seems to refer to the vfunc (as is also normal in GTK+), so document 
	how the GError should be used and point out that the application 
	should translate the message and show an appropriate dialog.
	This does not seem to require the definition of a new GError domain - 
	the existing one seems suitable.

2007-05-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Real fix for a gtk_tree_model_row_inserted oddity
	* The problem was that me->cur_len was set to 1 to avoid an assertion
	in gtktreemodelsort.c (in gtk_tree_model_sort_build_level). The real
	fix was to check for list_model->cur_len in various GtkTreeModel
	implementations, rather than the list_model->items->len (only
	registered items are valid for GtkTreeModel, while registering is
	slower than simple appends or prepend, as registered requires the
	registration event to happen in the mainloop)

	* Fixes for a bunch of tickets
	* Fixed the IDLE support for folders with == 0 items

2007-05-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Workaround for a gtk_tree_model_row_inserted oddity 

2007-05-07 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Fixed some use-before-initalization bugs in tny-maemo-conic-device
	* Don't try to disconnect in the dummy case there

2007-05-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Moved some stuff around
	* Created an internal API for status reporting

2007-05-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Changed the TnyGetMsgCallback function signature to have a cancelled 
	property.
	* Implemented support for status-callbacks for tny_folder_get_msg_async
	* Changed the demoui to use the get_msg_async functionality for testing
	recent changes

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/Makefile.am:
	* libtinymail/tny-idle-stopper-priv.c:
	* libtinymail/tny-idle-stopper-priv.h: Added a helper API to allow 2 or
	more idle handler callbacks to cooperate, so that one can stop the other
	one, in case they are called in an unexpected sequence, which happens 
	when they have different idle priorities. See the API documentation here
	for more details.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_destroyer),
	(tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_callback), (destroy_progress_idle),
	(progress), (tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_status),
	(tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_default): Use shared TnyIdleHandler 
	instances, so that the main idle callback can stop the progress idle 
	callback from calling the status callback after the main callback, 
	which causes freed memory to be used, crashing modest. See the comments
	here fore more details.

	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c: Added some text to the 
	tny_folder_refresh_async() callbacks to make the sequence clearer. 
	I think that language bindings will actually need one or more destroy 
	callbacks eventually.

2007-05-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Massive changes to TnyGetMsgQueue (unfinished, experimental)
	* Fix for urgent ticket #43

2007-05-03  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>
	* tests/functional/folder-lister-async.c: Fixed a build error in the
	tests caused by the API changes of yesterday
	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: Fixed a call to
	_get_folders_async() that was receiving the arguments in a wrong
	order

2007-05-02  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Change API headers of async functions to pass a status callback
	method to get progress information about task execution. 
	* transfer_msgs_async_fun
	* get_folders_async_func
	* Camel implementation functions have been changed, but NULL 
	was assigned to status_callback, for the moment.

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-30  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added a TnyCombinedAccount type

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Documentation updates
	* Made a few symbols start with an underscore, so that they are not
	exported by the linker

2007-04-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-account-store.c:
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_store_account),
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_transport_account):
	Correct NY_ACCOUNT_STORE typos to TNY_ACCOUNT_STORE, to avoid an 
	undefined symbol build error.

	(tny_olpc_device_reset), (tny_olpc_device_force_online),
	(tny_olpc_device_force_offline): 
	Copy/Paste the implementations from TnyGnomeDevice, so these 
	implementations also match the documented behaviour. I wish that 
	GInterfaces could have default implementations that could be shared.

2007-04-28  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Documentation updates
	* Changes to the TnyAccountStore API
	* Removed the memory peak of yesterday (for the unread and total count)

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Getting the unread and total counts correct. Latest changes
	introduce a memory peak at application startup. This peak can be
	improved by only reading the unread and total counts from the
	summary.mmap files in camel-lite (right now, the entire folder's info
	is read and parsed, causing the peak to occur)

	* Fixed the TnyGenericSendQueue implementation

2007-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-device.c: Improve the documentation for 
	tny_device_force_online(), tny_device_force_offline(), and 
	tny_device_reset(), describing why/when you might want to use them, 
	and describing how they affect the behaviour of this object. This 
	helps us to implement the underlying vfuncs.

	* libtinymail-gnome-desktop/tny-gnome-device.c:
	(tny_gnome_device_reset), (tny_gnome_device_force_online),
	(tny_gnome_device_force_offline):
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_reset), (on_connection_event),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_online),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_offline),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init): Improve the implementation, 
	to match the documented behaviour.

2007-04-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Creating a new connection for getting uncached messages 
	with the IMAP code.

2007-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap): Added some 
	comments and  improved the (temporary) debug output so its more 
	obvious what is happening.

	* libtinymail/tny-device.c: Correct the tny_device_force_offline() and 
	tny_device_force_online() documentation. They were swapped.
	This still needs more documentation describing how these behave.

2007-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_new): Do all the initialization in init, 
	because _new functions should just call g_object_new() and not 
	access private API, because they are just C convenience functions.
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_connect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_disconnect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_online),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_offline),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): 
	Copy the iap string instead of just storing the pointer, because 
	we have no guarantees about the lifetime of the string that 
	con_ic_event_get_iap_id() returns. Free it in finalize.
	Added g_return_if*() checks for priv->cnx, without which nothing 
	could work.

2007-04-23  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* tny_folder_change_set_received_msg,
	tny_folder_change_get_received_msg and
	TNY_FOLDER_CHANGE_CHANGED_MSG_RECEIVED added

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-24 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Make tinymail/maemo buildable with or without libconic

2007-04-23  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Introduction of the TnyStatus infrastructure
	* Changed the TnyStatusCallback function prototype to reflect the
	TnyStatus changes
	* Updated the demo-ui to start using the TnyStatus infrastructure

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-23 Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente

	* Change priority flags management, using a bit mask to get assigned 
	priority.
	* New enumeration to define available priority flags. 

2007-04-21  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Created a TnyGenericSendQueue which implements TnySendQueue in a
	generic way (doesn't strictly depend on the libtinymail-camel impl
	libraries like the TnyCamelSendQueue type)
	* Added the status_callback to tny_folder_get_msg_async
	* Renamed the TnyFolderRefreshStatusCallback to TnyStatusCallback

	* This was a minor API change (new type added)
	* This was a major API change for tny_folder_get_msg_async and
	tny_folder_refresh_async (TnyStatusCallback added and renamed)

2007-04-21  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Made TnyGetMsgQueue not care about the folder (it'll use the
	tny_header_get_folder API)

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-20  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Further implementing of TnyMergeFolder
	* Bugfixes in camel-lite (concurrent camel_folder_get_message on
	folders that are not selected)
	* Introduction of libtinymail-queues (which depens on asyncworker)

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-18  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Further implementing of TnyMergeFolder
	* Bugfixing of several trac tickets (like #39)

2007-04-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_disconnect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_current_iap_id),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_free_iap_list):
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.h:
	Take a TnyMaemoConicDevice* instead of a TnyDevice, as that is 
	the convention for derived/implemented objects.
	Correct the TNY_TYPE_MAEMO_CONIC_DEVICE implementation so that 
	this can be used. 

2007-04-17  Shilpa Musti  <Shilpa.Musti@nokia.com>

	* Bugfix in TnyCamelTransportAccount

2007-04-17  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Further implementing of TnyMergeFolder
	* Bugfix in TnyGtkHeaderListModel
	* Updates to the documentation

2007-04-17  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* Fixed a build error regarding the new TnyMaemoConicDevice

2007-04-17  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Add the TnyMaemoConicDevice, which exposes libconic-specific
	functionality. When built for scratchbox, it tries to work in 'dummy
	mode', to make it still somewhat functional, even though connectivity
	does not work in scratchbox. The conic-specifics are only lightly
	tested. and need work, esp. for doing something in sbox

	* TnyMaemoDevice goes back to the dummy it was before, so this should
	make pre-libconic compiles (770) also possible; not tested though.

2007-04-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Introduction of the TnyMergeFolder type

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-13  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* remove #include for removed tny-maemo-password-dialog.h,
	  this broke the compilation

2007-04-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added skeleton for ACAP support
	* Major modifications to the 'getting of passwords'
	* Introduction of the TnyPasswordGetter interface

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-11  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed ticket #40

2007-04-11  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Improve tny-maemo-device so it works a bit better

2007-03-30  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Support for low, high and normal X-Priority
	* Auto updating the unread count of TnyFolderObservers when unread
	flags are set on a TnyHeader
	* Fixed incrementally filling up a GtkTreeView while downloading is
	taking place (this needs a few small performance improvements btw).	

	* This was a major API change

2007-03-27  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: added a missing folder
	reference when getting folders

2007-03-25  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Support for filling up the header view (a.k.a. the summary view)
	with already or recently downloaded information while downloading is
	taking place. Take a look at the demo user interface's code to learn
	how to leverage this feature: You basically need to register the list
	(which will for example be a TnyGtkHeaderListModel instance) with the
	TnyFolderMonitor before launching the tny_folder_refresh_async method.

	* This ain't an API change, but this new feature does make more
	possible with the same API. It might also change behaviour a little
	bit (although it shouldn't for the old-style of using the 
	TnyFolderMonitor, or at least not as far as I know and tested).

2007-03-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Added the tny_account_store_find_account API. It's possible that in
	future a set and get find strategy API will be added. For now, finding
	using only the url-string will suffice (and adding the find strategy
	later wont break the existing API, or at least doesn't have to as far
	as I can see now -- I might laugh at this entry in future, we'll see)
	
	* Changes to the TnyAccountStore implementations, it's more typical 
	now to let the account store store the instances internally, rather 
	than letting it always return new instances. How else are you going 
	to find the original TnyAccount instance with 
	tny_account_store_find_account?

	* Added the tny_account_matches_url_string API, to determine whether a
	specific account instance matches a specific url_string.

	* This was a major API change

2007-02-20  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Disabled the LIST with LSUB merging (it just doesn't sound right to
	do this, yet Evolution's Camel does this, as a result did camel-lite
	it too. No longer, for now).

2007-02-19  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* TnyCamelFolder: Replaced the folder lock by a recursive static
	folder lock

	* Introduction of the new TnySendQueue interface
	* Added a lot assertions to check for type safety
	* Made expunging of a folder work while headers are still active.

	* This was a major API change

2006-11-06  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Introduction of the TnyMsgRemoveStrategy, which makes it more
	flexible to define how tinymail should remove messages (as this might
	be specific per device). Although this means a major API change, not a
	lot external API has changed. A default remove strategy is used for
	each folder and is implemented as TnyCamelMsgRemoveStrategy. This
	is an overwritable property.

	* Major refactoring in the TnyMimePartSaveStrategy stuff
	* Introduced a new client-type for the strategy pattern:
	the TnyMimePartSaver
	* Removed all saving functionality from the default gtk+
	types: the developer who will create an E-mail client is
	the person who should connect the dots (inherit a TnyMsgView
	and/or a TnyMimePartView, or implement it fully, and let that
	type also implement the TnyMimePartSaver)
	* Renamed TnySaveStrategy to TnyMimePartSaveStrategy

	*  This was a major API change in libtinymailui
	
2006-10-13  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Bugfix in tny-camel-folder.c, added documentation aid
	* Fixed possible memory leak

2006-09-25  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Aggressively hardened the TnyCamelFolder implementation. This
	hardening isn't good for debugging, as major bugs and mistakes now
	won't crash. Therefore it's possible that some hardening is going to
	come inbetween #ifdef/#endif's so that developers still get a crashing
	tinymail. However. I soon want to release, therefore this hardening
	tries to on forehand detect problems with the CamelFolder instance.

	These problems specifically arise when CamelOperation cancellations
	have happened. The problem is that the instance (priv->folder) isn't
	always a CamelFolder anymore (especially after cancellation). Sure
	this is a Camel bug or probably a Camel bug, but tinymail crashes
	cause of it. Tinymail's 1.0 release shouldn't crash, period.

	This doesn't mean that I will leave this work-around hack for what it
	is. I will indeed investigate and find the real bug that is causing
	this to happen. Why else do you think I leave a big fat fucking note
	in the ChangeLog for everybody to see?

	Feel free to help me spot it, and/or fix it.

2006-09-19  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed compilation for OLPC, GPE and Maemo platforms

	* Removed silly API in TnySessionCamel, solved the need for the API internally
	* Bug fixes in TnySessionCamel
	* Introduction of TnyGtkFolderTreeModel (however, it's atm unfinished)
	* Introduction of TnyGtkAccountListModel which could be useful for for
	example the GtkComboBox view component, the TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel
	doesn't change in functionality. It's also likely that a
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel will also be implemented at some point. The
	TnyGtkAccountListModel in combination with such a
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel used on a GtkComboBox and a GtkTreeView would
	mimic the behaviour of the TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel on a GtkTreeView by
	separating the two views (for example a combo box with accounts and a
	treeview with folders in the current account, rather than only support
	for a treeview with both accounts and folders)
	* Added documentation about the Gtk+ tree model column enumerations
	* Added documentation about tinymail enumerations

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-camel

	* Fixed a reference counting problem on TnyList::copy

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail

2006-09-08  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Fixed the Python bindings
	* Fixed the TnyIterator API (current -> get_current, as it's a
	property like any other property)
	* Added lots of samples to the API reference documentation

2006-08-25  Philip Van Hoof <philip@codeminded.be>

	* Lots of files: Removed the tny_folder_iface_uncache API and replaced 
	it with a detection mechanism that automates this. It will now uncache 
	the folder once there's no more header instances of that folder being 
	referenced.

	This indeed means that the reference counting of the headers must be 
	carefully monitored and absolutely correct. Some of the changes of this
	commit included fixes for this. For example the reparenting of the 
	header instance didn't happen in the TnyMsgViewIface implementations in
	ui-gtk and ui-mozembed.
